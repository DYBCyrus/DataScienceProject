    "The limitation of language, time period and the ratings themselves. \n",
    "Firstly, more than 70% of the movies are English speaking movies, which exclude parts of movies in other language. The similar problem also exists in the rater side. As an English-based website, IMDb fails to include the opinion of peoples from non-English speaking countries. \n",
    "Secondly, almost all selected movies are produced between 2006 and 2016, which exclude movies produced in 20 century. However, these movies consist a considerable large portion of the top 50 rated movie list on IMDB website. \n",
    "Thirdly, since IMDb is a public site that everyone can edit and comment, it is possible that some high-rating movies are rated by a group of fans and they might sabotage the accuracy of the rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we do not find any other issues. \n",
    "To handle the issues we discovered, for the limited time period, we want to find more datasets to fill the lack of data before 2006; for the limited movie languages, we will try to find datasets including the information of foreign movies, or we just focus on the English language movies specifically to avoid this bias; for the rating issue, it is the hardest thing to deal with. We want to try our best to avoid those notorious movies that have been unfairly rated and clean out outliers. "

    "As we all know, winning Oscar boosts a movie’s reputation hugely. Best picture award is always deemed as a quality-guarantee for a movie. If our hypothesis is correct, it means that the public’s taste of a movie may not match up with that of Academy’s. The IMDb ratings provide a highly democratic public reviews to movies and more importantly, they evolved over time. The tenuous correlation between IMDb ratings and award-winning movies indicates that, through other sources, like IMDb communities, we are more likely to find “good” movies. It also means that rating communities like IMDb are more consistent with the public’s opinions.\n",

Thus, Oscars are indeed an important indication of movies merit.\n",

However, since IMDb is only one of the rating platforms, it is almost impossible to represent the whole group of movie viewers, as people of different tastes might be inclined to different rating platforms, like rotten tomatoes and etc. Hence, we expect our data to be biased.\n",
